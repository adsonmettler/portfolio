Hi!

Are you searching for a Marketing Specialist to bring your idea to life? Look no further!

As an experienced professional in the field, I understand the importance of having a visually stunning, functional, and accessible website that represents your unique brand and engages your audience.

I have been working since 2018, in marketing and web design, delivering business solutions to customers by leading projects, creating content, and managing marketing campaigns.

For example, in one of my latest projects this year (2024), for Bibliotheca (a company that provides innovative solutions for libraries), I delivered content assets for an end-to-end digital marketing campaign focused on branding and customer acquisition. I designed a landing page using Hubspot’s CMS platform, combined with the publishing of graphic and written content for email marketing, social media, and blog posts. Then I was able to deliver on time, successfully gaining approval, thanks to my organizational and multi-tasking skills.

In another work experience, within approximately six months, starting as a Sales Representative, I developed a marketing campaign that successfully attracted new customers for GardaPly, a new brand within the company that exports plywood for flooring, doors, and house structures. This effort resulted in container orders from the Netherlands, Lithuania, Poland, Virginia (USA), New York (USA), and Tennessee (USA), generating a significant new gross income of $814,000 in 2022 for Index International Business Limited.

In terms of analytical skills, I have been working on projects for my graduation in Web and Computer Programming at BYU–Idaho, where I could manipulate databases, on MySQL, and integrate CRUD functionality using Python to provide data analysis solutions.

I can say that my analytical skills began with my past experience as a Customer Support Specialist at IBM Brazil. I was acting in the post-sales, working closely with executives and sellers to manage B2B contracts and assist clients with financial issues. Through my work I could ensure they were receiving value from IBM services. As a result of my good work I was trusted to manage and report important accounts such as Xerox, JP Morgan, and Staples.

I would appreciate the opportunity of meeting with you to talk more about the job position and my experience. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Adson Mettler do Nascimento
